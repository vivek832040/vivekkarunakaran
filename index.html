  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I am &lt;Vivek Karunakaran&gt;. I am currently doing my first year PhD in &lt;STCS/TIFR&gt;.</p>
    <p>I completed my MSc in &lt;2016&gt; from &lt;Chennai Mathematical Institute&gt;. I had to take a gap from academia due to personal reasons, during which I explored various freelancing jobs — from farming to online tutoring, and many things in between.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I love solving mathematical puzzles and creating them as well. I have been active on several problem-solving platforms such as <a href="&lt;web linkhttps://research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/February2018.html&gt;" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
    <p>A few years back, I maintained a YouTube channel where I shared some of my favorite problems: <a href="&lt;https://www.youtube.com/@AsfuNtendstoINFINITY&gt;" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a>.</p>
    <p>I also maintain a blog where I post interesting problems and ideas (not active now): <a href="&lt;https://asfuntendstoinfinity.blogspot.com/&gt;" target="_blank">Visit Blog</a>.</p>

  <div class="section">
  <p>Currently, I am very much interested in Game Theory, Algorithmic aspects of Game Theory, and especially Combinatorial Game Theory. As one of the interest, I try to understand game-theoretical models to study evolutionary behavior, particularly within the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory.</p>
  <p>I also love to quietly observe plants, trees and insects — the little details of the natural world often fascinate me and bring a sense of calm and wonder.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Apart from academics, I love reading books. Here's my <a href="&lt;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47592174-vivek-karunakaran&gt;" target="_blank">Goodreads profile</a> if you’re curious!</p>
